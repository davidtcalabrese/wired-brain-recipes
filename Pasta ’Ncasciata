Ingredients
1 lb. macaroni-style pasta
14 oz. ground beef,
1 onion
½ lb. caciocavallo cheese, cut into strips
4 oz. Parmigiano Reggiano, grated 
2 eggplant
white wine
basil leaves
tomato sauce
salt
extra-virgin olive oil

Method
Wash then cut the eggplant into  ½″ cubes. Place them in a colander, sprinkle with coarse salt, and let them sit for an hour to release any excess water. 

Rinse the eggplant under running water and pat dry with a cloth. Fry them in a pan with plenty of extra-virgin olive oil, then remove and let them rest on a plate lined with paper towels, which will soak up any excess oil. 

In the meantime, chop the onion and sauté it for a few minutes in a pan with extra-virgin olive oil. Add the ground beef, ½ cup wine, and let cook for around 10 minutes. Add a few tablespoons of tomato sauce to the beef and continue cooking for around an hour. 

Preheat the oven to 350°F.

Cook the pasta in boiling salted water and drain it once it’s al dente. Transfer it into a baking dish, pour the sauce on top, and mix well. Add the eggplant, caciocavallo cheese, and basil, and top with the grated Parmigiano Reggiano. Place in the oven for 15 minutes and then serve with a glass of Nero d’Avola.
