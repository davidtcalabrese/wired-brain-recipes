INVOLTINI DI PESCE SPADA
200g of fine breadcrumbs
1 garlic clove, peeled and grated
2 tbsp of parsley, finely chopped
1 tbsp of capers, minced
1 tbsp of lemon juice
fine sea salt
freshly ground black pepper
500g of swordfish, thinly sliced
100ml of extra virgin olive oil
70g of smoked Provolone cheese, cubed

1
Preheat the oven to 200Â°C/gas mark 6. Line a baking tray with parchment and set aside
2
In a medium skillet set over a low heat, toast the breadcrumbs until golden and crisp, stirring often to avoid burning them
3
Transfer to a bowl and add the garlic, parsley, capers, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Stir to combine
4
Dip the swordfish slices in olive oil. Dredge them in the breadcrumbs on both sides, then place a cube of cheese at their centre and roll them up. Pierce them with skewers to keep them rolled up tight
5
Bake the swordfish rolls for 20 minutes, until the breading is deeply golden and the cheese is oozing
