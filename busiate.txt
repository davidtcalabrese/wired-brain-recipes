1 recipe Handmade Busiate
1 large tomato, cut into chunks
1 big bunch of fresh basil
¾ cup almonds
2 cloves garlic
¼ cup grated parmesan cheese, plus more for serving
½ cup extra virgin olive oil
Kosher salt, to taste
Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

Instructions
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add in the Handmade Busiate and cook for 4 minutes, until al dente.
Meanwhile, blend the tomato, basil, almonds, garlic, and parmesan cheese in a food processor or mortar and pestle, until roughly chopped. Stream in the olive oil while continuing to blend. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and red chili flakes. Pour into a large bowl.
Drain the cooked pasta and add to the bowl of pesto. Toss with a pair of tongs, then serve immediately topped with more grated parmesan cheese.
