Cara Cara and Blood-Orange Salad with Ricotta Salata

4 Cara Cara oranges

4 blood oranges, plus juice of 1 more blood orange

6 cups mixed salad greens, such as arugula and mizuna

6 ounces ricotta salata, crumbled

1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil

Freshly-ground black pepper

Step 1:
To peel oranges, using a sharp knife, cut a thin slice off both ends of fruit to reveal flesh and stand fruit upright. Then, following curve of fruit, cut downward to remove peel and white pith, rotating fruit as you work, until all of peel and pith is cut away.

Step 2:
Reserve peels for another use. Thinly slice oranges crosswise.

Step 3:
Arrange orange slices in a shallow serving bowl. Top with salad greens and sprinkle with ricotta salata.

Step 4:
In a small bowl, whisk together blood-orange juice and oil until blended, then drizzle over salad. Sprinkle with pepper, toss gently, and serve immediately.
