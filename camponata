Roast the eggplant. Traditionally, caponata is made with fried eggplant. Since eggplant soaks up oil like a sponge, I’ve significantly lightened up this dish by roasting the eggplant in a few tablespoons of oil instead. Roasted eggplant is golden, caramelized and beautifully suited for caponata. No need to salt the eggplant beforehand.
Prepare and cook the onion, celery and bell pepper. Since the eggplant requires about 30 minutes in the oven, we’ll have time to chop these vegetables and get them going.
Add garlic, followed by crushed tomatoes. We’ll sauté the garlic just long enough to enhance its flavor before pouring in the tomatoes.
Then add olives, raisins, vinegar, capers, honey, red pepper flakes and bay leaf. This is a lot to add at once—you can combine all of these in a bowl in advance to streamline this step.
Stir in the roasted eggplant, followed by a handful of fresh herbs. Almost done! Now you can tweak the flavors to make your caponata taste just right. If you have the time, let the caponata chill in the fridge for several hours, or overnight, before serving. I love it freshly made, too, though.
