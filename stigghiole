Yield: Makes 8 servings
Preparation Time: 1 hour
Eight 12 x 8-inch pieces caul fat

1 lamb heart or veal heart, tubes and veins removed, sliced into strips

Eight 10-inch long wooden skewers

8 scallions, trimmed

1 or 2 bunches parsley (about 40 sprigs), divided into 8 smaller bunches of about 5 sprigs each

8 sprigs fresh sage

Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste



1. Prepare an indirect hot charcoal fire or preheat one side of a gas grill on high for 15 minutes.

2. Caul fat is usually packed in salt already cleaned. Rinse them gently in a bowl. Skewer the heart strips lengthwise on the wooden skewers. Unfold the caul fat and lay them on a surface spread out like a handkerchief. Lay a skewer with its strip of heart on top of one edge of the caul fat.

3. On top of the skewered heart lay a whole scallion, a bunch of parsley, stems and all, and the sage sprig. Salt and pepper the skewers. Begin to wrap these ingredients up with the caul fat, making sure it is tight and firmly closed. Continue until all the ingredients are used up.

4. Place the skewers on the non-fire side of the grill and grill, turning frequently, until dark golden brown on all sides, 30 to 40 minutes, but keep a close eye on it. Serve directly from the grill.
